## Design Principles
- Show off working features prominently

- **Multi-file Comparison**: Select 2+ files → Compare tab → AI cross-analysis
- **Enrichment Analysis**: AI suggests how datasets can enrich each other
- **Correlation Detection**: Find relationships between datasets

## Coming Soon Features (Showcased in UI)
- **Images**: OCR, object detection, image classification
- **Audio**: Speech-to-text, sentiment analysis, speaker identification

## Key Demo Flow
1. Upload data files (CSV/Excel)
2. Select multiple files with checkboxes

5. Click "Analyze with AI" → Show impressive cross-dataset insights

## Remember
- Always prioritize visual polish and impressiveness
